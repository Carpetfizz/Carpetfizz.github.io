During my summer internship at VMware, I had the pleasure of building the company's first Apple Watch app. The app allows \"C-Level\" customers of VMware products to access contact information of their Technical Account Managers and their respective escalations. The Apple Watch app allows for quick customer support access to high level customers. The app was shipped and distributed at VMworld 2015.
