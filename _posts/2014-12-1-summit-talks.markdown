During my internship at Facebook, I was tasked with building technologies for my high school. Summit Talks is a student-driven, teacher-moderated group chat system that allows students to discuss projects and assignments online. My high school heavily focused on self directed learning and I believe a large part of being a responsible student is to know when to ask for help. Summit Talks provides a platform for students to message their peers, embed graphs, and YouTube videos right in the message. It features teacher moderation tools like muting, deleting & creating rooms, and inviting. The chat program also features advanced features like scrolling up to reveal older messages and joining multiple rooms at once.
