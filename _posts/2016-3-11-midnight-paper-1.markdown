# How can we make computers magical again?

I'll start at the very beginning of my conundrum, which started around 2014. I read a tweet from a novelty account (probably @horse_js) that said something along the lines of "all your apps are CRUD". For the uninitiated, CRUD stands for "create, read, update, and destroy" the four basic operations you can do on data. Most of the tools and services we use can be reduced to these operations. Let's look at a few examples:

- Email
	- **Create** an Email
		- Store and send a string of characters over a network
	- **Read** an Email
		- Retrieve a string of characters from a database
	- **Update** an Email
		- Store a string of characters to a database
	- **Destroy** an Email
		- Delete a string of characters from a database

- Social Networking
	- **Create** a Post
		- Store a string of characters to a database
	- **Read** a Post
		- Retrieve a string of characters from a database
	- **Update** a Post
		- Store a string of characters to a database
	- **Destroy** a Post
		- Delete a string of characters from a database

- Photosharing
	- **Create** a Photo
		- Store an image in a directory, store metadata in database
	- **Read** a Photo
		- Retrieve an image from a directory, retrieve metadata from database
	- **Update** a Photo
		- Store metadata in database
	- **Destroy** a Photo
		- Delete image from a directory, delete metadata from database

...

Notice a pattern? The only thing that is really changing between the examples is the name we give the data. A "Post", a "Tweet", and an "Email" are inherently just a string of characters being moved around in a database, presented in different ways, making the respective services unique. In no way am I trying to diminish the hard work of the engineers and designers who keep these services running because doing it at scale is an entirely different challenge. I'm also not trying to say that the technology that drives these services are short of amazing - I'm talking about the end user.

We have reached a point where the end user takes the "CRUD" of data for granted. Emails are expected to be read, Tweets are expected to be shared, and photos are expected to be commented on. This is a good thing, because it follows the natural progression of technology - people seamlessly adopting what was once arcane.

However, I assert that when something is no longer arcane, **it is no longer magical**. We need new technology that will once again envoke feelings of awe and wonder when using computers. Personally, I don't feel any awe or wonder when I send an email, and I doubt most people do. Fields like virtual reality, augmented reality, and autonomous vehicles have once again captured my fascination with computers because they are surrounded by an aura of mystique, unlike CRUD apps.

The magic of this new technology will naturally decay until something else crops up in place of it, thus pushing the envelope. Building more CRUD is the best way to push society forward, but not the best way to push technology forward.

It's 4:14AM, I'd be surprised if half of what I wrote is even close to being coherent. Hopefully I didn't appear too pessimistic of the current state of affairs.
