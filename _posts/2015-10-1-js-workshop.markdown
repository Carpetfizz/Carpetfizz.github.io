I teach Javascript workshops for Hackers@Berkeley, the largest computer science club on campus. I taught sessions at Cal Hacks 2.0 and throughout the semester. As the final project for the workshop, I created [imgur-voice](https://carpetfizz.github.io/imgur-voice/) which is a voice controlled imgur search. This demo goes through basics such as DOM manipulation and AJAX requests.
