This little website kickstarted my interest in using the web to improve the lives of people around me. My high school's experimental math program brought some initial challenges for students. They didn't know what to work on next so they just stopped working.  I learned PHP and mySQL in a weekend to import the Excel spreadsheet of student progress into a database. It then allowed for a student to input their ID number and receive a formatted table of their math progress. It even had SMTP support to send the student an email with the information. Thanks Ronak for still hosting it!
