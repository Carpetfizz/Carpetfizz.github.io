I built leapcapjs for entry in the Synopsys Science and Technology Championship and it won a prize from ACM. I consulted with a local physiotherapist to talk about how hand sensing technology could improve his work. He said that most patients often forget how to do excercises or do them incorrectly without supervision. I used the power of WebGL and the Leap Motion Controller to create a platform for rendering the human hand in real time, in the browser, and subsequently capture the motions so that they could be sent to a doctor for analysis. This project also had the potential for being integrated with web sockets to create a realtime doctor-patient solution.
