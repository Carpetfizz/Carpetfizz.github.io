I was one of the founding members for my high school's Creative Writing Club. We needed a place to post our writing and encourage other students to post their writing - so I built one. The Summit CWC website allows students to sign in with their Google account to write posts, format them in markdown, and tag them. It even has a customizable user account system. This was my account :) [http://summitcwc.appspot.com/author/aramesh](http://summitcwc.appspot.com/author/aramesh)
